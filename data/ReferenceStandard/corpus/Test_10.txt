1. The left ventricular appears normal. Left ventricular systolic function is moderately to severely reduced with estimated ejection fraction of 20% to 30&. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is observed.

CHAMBERS:
Elevated left atrial pressures seen upon Doppler examination.
2. The left atrium shows mild dilation. 
3. Right atrium and right ventricle appear normal.
4. Left ventriclular systolic dysfunction is present.

VALVES:
4. Mild stenosis of the aortic valve is observed with calcification. 5. No thickening of the mitral valve is seen
6. Mild mitral valve regurgitation is noted. 
7. Tricuspid valve regurgitation, thickening, and motion all appear normal.
8. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension is present. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 61 mmHg. Estimated right atrial pressure of 18 mmHg.
8. There is trace pulmonary valve insufficiency. The pulmonary valuve appears normal.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Study Type: 2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAM  and M-mode Doppler study of adequate quality. Information is in comparison to report on 09/17.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - FINDINGS:

1. Views of the heart and great vessels show normal intracardiac and great vessel relationships.
2. Notable chamber enlargement and hypertrophy is present.
3. The left ventricle is mildly enlarged to 6.0 cm, wall thickness is normal, with mild global hypokinesis with ejection fraction by 35% by M-mode and 40% by Simpson?s method.  
4. Pericardial effusion and vegetations are observed. 
5. Doppler interrogation, including color flow imaging, reveals systemic venous return to the right atrium with abnormal tricuspid inflow. 
6. Pulmonary outflow is abnormal at the valve. 
7. Pulmonary venous return is to the left atrium. 
8. The interatrial septum is intact. Mitral inflow and ascending aorta flow are abnormal. 
9. The aortic valve is trileaflet. 
10. The coronary arteries appear to be normal in their origins. 
11. The aortic arch is left-sided and patent with normal descending aorta pulsatility. 
12. Moderate LV systolic function is noted. Ejection fraction of 30%.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - CONCLUSIONS:
1. Study Quality: Nominal
2. LEFT VENTRICLE: abnormal systolic function
3. Aortic valve: Normal

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - SUMMARY:
Moderate left ventricular enlargement without remodeling. Moderate LV SYSTOLIC FUNCTION. Mild right atrial enlargement observed on 2D views with normal vena cava.

EXAM DESCRIPTION
Two dimensional and color flow Doppler was performed. Image quality was poor and technically limited.

COMMENTS:
1. Wall motion and left ventricular systolic function is low/borderline with estimated ejection fraction of 50% to 55%. 
2. There is increased left ventricular outflow consistent with low/borderline left ventricular systolic function. 
3. Elevated left atrial pressures are observed by Doppler examination.

CHAMBERS:
2. Mild dilation of the left atrium.
3. The right atrium and right ventricle appear normal.
4. The aortic root appears normal.

VALVES:
5. The aortic valve appears calcified with mild aortic valve stenosis, calculated aortic valve area is 1.3 cm square with a maximum instantaneous gradient of 34 mm and a mean gradient of 22 mm.
6. There is thickening of mitral valve leaflets as well as mild mitral valvue regurgitation. 
7. Tricuspid valve appears normal with trace tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 52 mmHg. Estimated right atrial pressure of 12 mmHg.
8. There is some pulmonary insufficiency.

MISCELLANEOUS:
9. No intracardiac mass is observed.
10. Color Doppler exam suggests hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.

IMPRESSIONS:
11. Normal left ventricle dimensions, systolic and diastolic function 
12. Color Doppler exam suggests right ventricular enlargement and hypertrophy
13. Hypertrophy has increased since previous study last week on 9/18. Estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of at least 50mmHG.

SUMMARY:
The study was somewhat technically limited and hence subtle abnormalities could be missed from the study.

LV Systolic function is low/borderline with estimated EF of 50-55%
